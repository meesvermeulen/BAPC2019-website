#### The end of VAT fraud

Summitto is an award-winning startup building the largest invoice registration network of the world. The purpose? Helping EU tax authorities to **eliminate 50 billion EUR in annual invoicing fraud**.

We are a **fully technology focused company**. Summitto wishes to make truly privacy-by-design technology available for the masses, through an open-source effort. We believe governments should use the tools which are in taxpayers' best interest.

By working closely as a team, we get the chance to make our engineering principles a reality. And maybe you have some great ideas to improve them! The founders of summitto set out to build a great company which respects people from all backgrounds. Some aspects which make us unique compared to other companies: we over-communicate internally; we share beyond our walls; we respect humans, not just code; and we always keep learning.

#### About our product

If you’re excited to stand at the forefront of a revolutionary product, and wish to work on something which will be used by **millions of companies**, whilst also doing something good for the world, we are looking for you!
Our young existence allows you to have a large impact. However, it also means that we require you to have a creative mindset that allows you to execute and communicate rapidly and effectively. We’re looking to bring together the best minds in cryptography, computer science and communications.

We have a clear set of long-term objectives, but give you the freedom to figure out how to get there. Your ideas are welcome. Feedback should not come top-down, but is for us a continuous process in which **everyone continuously debates, teaches and learns**. When the vision is clear for everyone in the team, it is time to execute using the best tools.
